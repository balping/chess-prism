## Controls

* Press `[F1]` or `[F6]` to display the help.

Promotion: select a new piece using the arrow keys then press `[EXE]`.

## Setup

There are two methods of rotating the board and the pieces:

1. Static: in this mode the board and the pieces aren't rotated during the gameplay. You can set the white and black side and you can set the directions of the white and black pieces.
2. Dynamic: in this mode the board and the pieces are rotated after every movement. You can set the side of the current player (who is symbolized by white) and the direction of the pieces of the current and of the opponent player.

## Files

This game saves two files to the main memory. You can find these in `Memory Manager/Main Memory/@CHESS`

These files are:

* GAME: contains your current gameplay. If you delete it, you won't be able to continue your paused game.
* SETTINGS: contains your settings. If you delete it, your settings are restored to default.
